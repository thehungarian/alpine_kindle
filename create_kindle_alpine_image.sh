# DEPENDENCIES
# qemu-user-static is required to run arm software using the "qemu-arm-static" command (I suppose you use this script on a X86_64 computer)
# Please install it via your package manager (e.g. Ubuntu) or whatever way is appropriate for your distribution (Arch has it in AUR)

# BASIC CONIGURATION
# REPO: The Alpine repository to use, you can leave it like it is
# MNT: Where you want to mount the image, just make sure /mnt/alpine isn't already used
# IMAGE: The path and name of the image file to be created, you can leave it as is
# IMAGESIZE: How big you want the image to be. If you want to install Chromium, a evince etc. you should go for at least 1400MB
# ALPINESETUP: This are the commands executed inside the Alpine container to set it up. Most notably it installs XFCE desktop environment,
#              and creates a user named "alpine" with password "alpine". The last command is "sh", which allows you to examine the
#              created image/install more packages/whatever. To finish the script just leave the sh shell with "exit"
# STARGUI: This is the script that gets executed inside the container when the GUI is started. Xepyhr is used to render the desktop
#          inside a window, that has the correct name to be displayed in fullscreen by the kindle's awesome windowmanager

# GETTING APK-TOOLS-STATIC

# again at the end of the script
